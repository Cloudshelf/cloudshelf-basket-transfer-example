An open-source example of how to handle [Cloudshelf Basket Transfer](https://documentation.cloudshelf.ai/plugins/cloudshelf-basket-transfer)

#### Built with:
| Purpose  | Technology |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Next.Js Framework  | [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)  |
| GraphQL | [Apollo GraphQL](https://apollographql.com/)  |
| Code Style | [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)  |


#### Please Note:
This is example code only! It will give you a starting point but there are several changes you might want to make in production. 

For example: 
In ApolloClientFactory.ts you need to provide your own API Key. It's your responsibility to ensure your API Key stays on the server-side.

If you are just looking on how to query the order(or mark it as paid) check out OrdersService.ts

More detailed information can be found in our documentation: [Omnichannel API Documentation](https://documentation.cloudshelf.ai)
